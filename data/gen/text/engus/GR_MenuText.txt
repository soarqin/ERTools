121010	If you set a multiplayer password, you'll only be matched with other players using the same password for most multiplayer features.\n\nHowever, multiplayer passwords do not apply to invasion or support multiplayer.
121011	If you set a group password, you'll be more likely to see messages, summon signs, bloodstains, phantoms, and so on from others using the same password.\n\nElements given this special priority will appear differently from others.
121100	With a Furlcalling Finger Remedy, you can see summon signs, which can be used to summon players from other worlds.\n(Finger Remedies are consumed with use.)\n\nThere are various types of summon signs.\nGold signs summon Furled Finger cooperators.\nRed signs summon duelist adversaries.\n(For either type of multiplayer, the summoning player becomes Host of Fingers.)
